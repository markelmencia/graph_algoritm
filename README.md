Some algoritms related to Graph Theory.
\
\
Graph Theory is a very prevalent field in Computer Science and is used in several algoritms for a wide range of purposes. These are some graph algoritms I've learned in my Discrete Mathematics class, coded in Python.

## Graph Isomorphism Algoritm

This algoritm is used to determine whether two graphs are isoporphic or not. [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) the Wikipedia page about graph isomorphism.
